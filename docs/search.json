    "text": "LANDFIRE & The Nature Conservancy\nLANDFIRE (Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools) is a shared program between the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Fire and Aviation branch and the U.S. Department of the Interior. LANDFIRE provides 25+ national landscape-scale geo-spatial products, 950 vegetation models, and a suite of tools that support all-lands planning, management, and operations. Included in the product suite are current and historic conditions including ecosystem dynamic models that can be used for conservation, fire planning, and landscape management decisions.\nThe Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a Major Partner in the LANDFIRE Program supported by a cooperative agreement through USDA Forest Service. TNC’s LANDFIRE Team works closely with the LANDFIRE Business Leads, program staff, and other partners to provide support to LANDFIRE and the user community by:\n\nHelping users understand the strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate uses of LANDFIRE products.\nLocating, obtaining, and using geospatial data, tools, and models for fire and natural resource management, planning, and implementation.\nIdentifying and comparing management priorities, evaluating threats to ecosystems, and exploring outcomes under alternative management scenarios.\n\n\nTNC’s LANDFIRE Team is advancing conservation outcomes through collaborative ecosystem science by supporting LANDFIRE users as they locate, obtain and apply the diverse suite of LANDFIRE products and data.\n\nCreated by TNC Ecologist, Randy Swaty, this preliminary landscape assessment leverages LANDFIRE’s unique geospatial products to advance beneficial outcomes for the wildland fire and natural resource communities. The central data in each project are created and managed by the cooperative inter-agency/inter-organizational LANDFIRE program.\nThese charts, maps, and graphs are based on current LANDFIRE products, and provide a starting point for further analysis. All maps, input datasets and further assistance can be obtained by contacting the author, Randy Swaty.\nSubstantial code contributions for GIS data processing by Myles Walimaa."
